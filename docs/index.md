# Hey there!

Thanks for stopping by. ðŸ™ƒ

Hi, Iâ€™m Apurvaâ€¯Misraâ€”a machine learning engineer, and founder of Sentick, where we help growing companies unlock practical, ROIâ€‘driven AI solutions.

# What I Do

I help teams go from idea â†’ production with AIâ€‘powered products and automations that deliver measurable results.

â€¢ Automations â€“ endâ€‘toâ€‘end workflow orchestration with LLM agents to eliminate repetitive tasks and cut operating costs.

â€¢ Predictive Analytics â€“ data pipelines and models that anticipate demand, pricing, and risk so you can act before the market does.

â€¢ AI Marketing â€“ GPTâ€‘powered content, dynamic segmentation, and campaign optimisation that measurably lifts conversions.

â€¢ Chatbots & Virtual Assistants â€“ customerâ€‘facing and internal copilots that resolve queries instantly and free up your team.

# Why Consulting?

Earlyâ€‘stage teams often need senior technical guidance long before they can justify a fullâ€‘time ML hire. I step in as your fractional ML leadâ€”shaping strategy, shipping version 1, and leaving you with a maintainable stack and measurable ROI.

# My Background

I am an Electronics and Communications engineer turned Machine Learning Engineer with experience in various domains including, eye tracking, locational, physiological, text, chatbot, rate prediction, recommendation, cloud infastructure and more. I did my Masters from the University of Waterloo with research in Cognitive Driver Distraction Detection (detecting driver distraction when they are thinking of something else not the same as looking somewhere else), this was my segway to machine learning, experimental design and hypothesis testing. During and after my Masters I worked at a bunch of startups using Machine learning in various ways like fatigue detection for Radiologists, allergen detection in restaurant menus using NLP, creating chatbots in the insurance space and also worked on creating a personal assistant to book you an Uber, order food etc. I am AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate and love helping startups setup an efficient/robust cloud infrastructure and reduce their cloud cost.
