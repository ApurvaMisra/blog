I help teams go from idea → production with AI‑powered products and automations that deliver measurable results.

• Automations – end‑to‑end workflow orchestration with LLM agents to eliminate repetitive tasks and cut operating costs.

• Predictive Analytics – data pipelines and models that anticipate demand, pricing, and risk so you can act before the market does.

• AI Marketing – GPT‑powered content, dynamic segmentation, and campaign optimisation that measurably lifts conversions.

# My Background

I’m an Electronics & Communications engineer turned Machine Learning engineer and the founder of Sentick. I help growing teams become AI-first by turning messy, real business workflows into practical AI systems like automations, analytics, and AI copilots that ship to production and show ROI.

I earned my Master’s at the University of Waterloo, where my research focused on cognitive driver distraction detection. This is detecting distraction from what a person is thinking, not just where they are looking. My work has been published in IEEE Access and has 100+ citations.

Since then, I’ve built ML and NLP systems across domains including healthcare, insurance, recommendations, forecasting, and conversational AI. I also love the education side of AI and help leaders and teams understand what’s genuinely useful and how to apply it through 40+ talks, workshops, and training sessions, with my Youtube channel at 10000+ views.
